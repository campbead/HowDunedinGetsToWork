How Dunedin Gets to Work is a lightweight app allowing Dunedin residents to visualise commuting patterns in their city.  Designing for a wide audience, I choose to emphasise simplicity, visual impact, and interactivity.

I envision most users will use this app on their smartphone, guiding design decisions toward simplicity.  By choosing to limit my app to Dunedin, I minimize data usage and load time.  A simple interface maximizes display space for the map, especially on small-screen devices.  Because most areas in Dunedin have few jobs compared to population, I choose to limit commuting information to be based on where people live, not where they work. A light-coloured base-map, allows users to navigate without visual obstruction.

A key to this app's visual impact is the choice of a diverging blue-red colour palette (colour blind friendly), providing a representation of scores. This allows users to quickly compare commuting patterns for a given transportation mode, relative to the city average.  For a given transportation mode, a zero score (the city average) is represented by the lowest intensity colour.  Colour intensity increases as the score moves away from zero, meaning a greater difference between the absolute number of commuters and the city average.

Interacting with an area reinforces the visual map data with additional contextual information.  A drop-down allows users to select from a list of the most prominent transportation modes. Detailed explanation of scoring and other information is located in a separate tab, being available for power users, but concealed from casual users.
